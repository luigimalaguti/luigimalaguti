### Ciao 👋

I am computer engineering student at UNIMORE, in Modena, Italy 🇮🇹

### Education 📚

Currently I'm studying computer engineering at UNIMORE 👨‍💻.

In these years I'm learning some languages, like C, Java, Python, SQL, Shell - Bash, I'm learning development techniques like Desing Patterns and some basic algorithms. In addition, I am also learning UNIX-like system architectures, computer architectures, like RISC, and network architectures.

Well... I'm trying to learn as much as possible 👨‍🎓 (it's a bit difficult 🤫).

### Writing ✍

I'm currently writing some repositories for trying to study some subject.

For now, I writed:

- [Learn Dynamic Languages](https://github.com/luigimalaguti/LearnDynamicLanguages) - ITA 🇮🇹 - WORK IN PROGRESS 🚧
