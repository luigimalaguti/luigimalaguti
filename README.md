### Ciao 👋

### Education 📚

Currently I'm studying computer engineering at UNIMORE 👨‍💻.

In these years I'm learning some languages, like C, Java, Python, SQL, Shell - Bash, I'm learning development techniques like Desing Patterns and some basic algorithms. In addition, I am also learning UNIX-like and network system architectures.

Well... I'm trying to learn as much as possible 👨‍🎓 (it's a bit difficult 🤫).
